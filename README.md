# bubble-datetime-picker
This repository contains a Go implementation of a terminal-based hour selector model using the Bubble Tea framework. The model allows users to increment and decrement hours, minutes, and seconds, and navigate between them using keyboard input. Itâ€™s designed to be a simple and intuitive component for terminal user interfaces (TUIs).
